<h3><center>History</center></h3>
<p>
Cuba is small country, it is an island in the Caribbean. It is a spanish speaking country. Its largest city is also it's capital and it is called Havana. Christopher Columbus discovered the country in 1492, however, it was already inhabited by many different Mesoamerican tribes. Cuba was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American war in 1898. It gained independence in 1902 and was in a fragile econmoic state, and it established a socialist goverrment led by Fidel Castro. It has been a Communist country since 1965 and is under a trade embargo with the United States of America. Cuba had many groups of people try to invade them in the earlier years of it being established. For hundreds of years many pirates and other groups and countries would frequently target Cuba in an attempt to gain it's riches. In todays time, Cuba is very well known for its sugar and cigars. Since The United States has a no trade policy (embargo) with Cuba, it makes their Cuban-made cigars very elusive. Many people try to illegally smuggle them into the US to either sell or to use themselves, but this is against the law because of our trade embargo.

<h3><center>Econmoics</center></h3>
<p>Cuba is a Communist country, which means most of the countrys production is controlled by the government as well as distribution. The labor force is also composed of mainly government employed individuals. Most citiznes do not choose their trade, instead the are appointed by the government into what line of work they will occupy. Prior to Fidel Castro's dictatorian government, Cuba had a thriving economy with a higher standard of living than many other countries. If the US would lift the embargo on Cuba, their country could be much more successful than it is today. We could begin again to import and export with them. Obviously the idea of free trade helps Cuba more than the United States. The United States could benefit from the gain in the increase in sugar suppliers and could legally obtain their cigars and other products; but Cuba would be able to get the benefits of being able to buy new American automobiles and other US goods. The only item we can trade without the restriction of the embargo on Cuba is medicine. The reason we will trade that is becasue the United States will not deprive human beings of something that could save their life or something that could create healthy people. The United States has considered lifting the embargo a few times, but has yet to actually do it. The US will only lift the embargo if the Cuban government will become more adaptive and flexable with many of their communist policies.
