A must see when visiting Cuba is Old Havana. Old Havana is a large colonial city in Cuba that was founded by the Spanish in 1519. It is located in the Harbor of the Bay of Havana. Old Havana was a stopping point for the Spanish between the "Old World" and the "New World". Theres about 3000 buildings in the ancient city, although many had fallen in the later half of the 20th century. However, many of the buildings are currently being restored to try and preseve the old city. In the early life of the town the city had little defense, and pirates came to plounder the riches of the city. Although the pirates did not find much wealth in the city, they still burned it down when they left, leaving much of the city destroyed. After the incident the Spanish sent over troops to try and protect the city from future invaders. <br> <A href=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g147271-d149029/Havana:Cuba:Old.Havana.html><img src=havana.jpg width=454> Click on this picture for a link to book a trip</A>
